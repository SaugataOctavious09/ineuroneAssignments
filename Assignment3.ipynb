    "Advantages of using **functions** in programs.\n",
    "* **Reusability**:- Functions can be reused across different parts of your program or even in different projects, saving you time and effort.<br>\n",
    "* **Modularity**:- Complex tasks are broken down into understandable simple small pieces of code, which are named as functions.<br>\n",
    "* **Code Organization**:- It is an organized way to present the cause,this improves the clarity of the code. <br>\n",
    "* **Redable and well mainatainance**:- Functions help us to read tthe code easily and maintain the codes easily.<br>\n",
    "* **Testing**:- A small piece of function can be testeed outside the whole code to see its functioning correctly.<br>\n",
    "* **Documentation**:- Functions help to write the documentation of the code easily.<br>\n",
    "* **Fixing error**:- Functions are used for using the code in isolation so the error can be found and fixed easily."
